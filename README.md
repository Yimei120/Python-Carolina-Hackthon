# Python-Carolina-Hackthon

•  Accomplished a data analysis project regarding to crime category prediction within 24 hours by employing real-life datasets
   of crimes in Chapel Hill, including Police Incidents Reports Written and Police Arrests Made.

•  Utilized Python Pandas and NumPy to index and clean databases, and then employed Python Matplotlib and Tableau to construct
   histograms, correlation matrix and distribution maps to analyze the trend and observe the distribution of raw data.

•  Constructed a K-Nearest-Neighbor model to predict potential crime categories with chosen variables, such as gender, race, age, or
   ethnicity, and the highest accuracy of the model is 40.52% when k equals to 40.

•  The crime category the model could predict most accurately was DWI (Driving While Intoxicated). With this model, police could
   be able to prevent this kind of crime given particular human characteristics.
